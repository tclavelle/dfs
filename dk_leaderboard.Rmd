### Meatpoles Season Championship Standings

The following table summarizes the final standings for the Meatpoles 2022 Season Championship. The standings are based on each team's top 14 scores during the 18 week NFL regular season. This allows teams to throw out their worst four scores.

+ **Runner-up**: $100
